###  ![#0000FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000FF/000000?text=+) Water Quality Project <!--(3)-->

The goal of the project is to classify the water usage (potable or not) based on chemical and physical properties. To be more specific the goal is to classify if the water is potable without misclassifying not safe to potable this is why we used precision as our metric for the project.
